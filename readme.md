Information on datasets:

The following explanations are based on the heart-disease.NAMES file.

**Number of instances:**

-   Cleveland: 303

-   Hungarian: 294

-   Switzerland: 123

-   Long Beach VA: 200

**Number of attributes:** 76 (including the predicted attribute) See
appendix for the complete list. (Missing Attribute Values: Several.
Distinguished with value -9.0.)

"This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments
refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland
database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this
date."

**Class distribution:** (Classtype (domain \[0,4\]) is referring to
feature 58 "num". It is an integer valued from 0 (absence of disease) to
4. In this project, the different levels for heart disease were taken in
account during the analysis.

Note: For this data science project, **[only the following. data files
were used]{.ul}**:

For the sake of completeness, nonetheless, we did include the whole
folder.

Preparing the datasets:

First step: rename .data files (0 raw .data) to .csv (1 raw .csv).

Second step: format the .csv files via python script "formatter" (2
formatted .csv). This step was needed because the original data was
badly formatted. The formatter.py formats the datasets, such that all
features of one patient are one row and not scattered over multiple
rows.

Third step: adding a header for the 76 features (data).

We finally get 4 files in our data folder:

| Filename                    | Md5-Hash                         |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|

**Process of Visualization and Analyse**

The processing of the data was done in the following order.
Pre-processing and (general) visualization, feature selection,
reduction, and finally classification. We focus and start in this
project on working with the whole dataset and not the pre-processed
files, which only include a tiny subset of the features, to finally
compare the locations with each other.

It is in general a good idea to start with some visualizations get a
rough overview. In a second step, the selection is crucial, because 76
features go beyond the constraints of reasonable analysis. Using the
RandomForestClassifier, 25 features were found to have the most impact
on the data. For the dimensionality reduction the following approaches
were used: t-SNE and UMAP as well as the autoencoders with R.
Furthermore, a list of classification algorithms used for this project
are listed below:

-   Logistic Regression

-   Naïve Bayes

-   SVM (linear, poly (degree = 3) and kernel (rbf))

-   KNN (nn = 5)

-   Neural Networks

VI. **FEATURES SELECTION**

Below are listed the top five most important features for each location
as well as their result for the Autoencoder.

**Cleveland :**

Laddist -- "distal left anterior descending artery" seems to be one of
the most important features. Indeed, it is part of the left main
coronary artery (LAD), supplying more than half of the blood to the
heart.

Thal -- "exercise thallium scintigraphy" is a diagnostic method in
nuclear medicine that enables the visualization of well-perfused and
vital tissue of myocardium by means of 201thallium absorbed by its
cells. This method is used to evaluate the character of soft tissue
lesions. In this dataset the feature is divided into three categories
from normal to defect.

Om1 -- "first obtuse marginal branch" is also an important vessel that
is part of the left main coronary artery (LAD).

Ca -- "number of major vessels".

Rcaprox -- "proximal right coronary artery" is part of the right
coronary artery (RCA).

Autoencoders

(./mdMediaFolder/media/image2.png)
**Hungary :**

Cp -- "chest pain" seems to be selected as the most important feature.
It is divided into four categories: type: 1 = typical angina; 2 =
atypical angina; 3 = non-angina pain; 4 = asymptomatic.

Painexer -- "pain provoked by exertion". It is divided into two
categories: 1 if the patient felt pain during effort, 0 otherwise.

Oldpeak -- "exercise-induced ST depression relative to rest" is an
exercise electrocardiography test to evaluate whether the trace in the
ST segment is abnormally low below the baseline which is often a sign of
myocardial ischemia.

Lvx4 -- not used / not described / no information regarding this
feature.

Exang -- "Exercise-induced angina". It is divided into two categories:
1:yes, 0: otherwise.

-   Autoencoders

(./mdMediaFolder/media/image3.png)

**[Switzerland :]{.ul}**

Cxmain -- "circumflex". It is another vessel that is part of the left
main coronary artery (LAD),

ID -- identification of patient, not relevant.

Thalach -- "maximum heart rate achieved" refers to the maximum heart
rate achieved during thalium stress test. At first sight, we might
suppose that the maximum heart rate is lower for those diagnosed with
heart diseases. Indeed, it seems logical to assume that a higher rate
indicates a satisfactory heart condition since it managed to increase
its rate to such a level during the stress test.

Tpeakbps -- "peak exercise systolic blood pressure".

Age -- "age of the patients".

-   Autoencoders

(./mdMediaFolder/media/image4.png)

**[Long Beach :]{.ul}**

Rcaprox -- "proximal right coronary artery" is part of the right
coronary artery (RCA).

Ladprox -- "proximal left anterior descending artery" which is part of
LAD.

Cxmain -- "circumflex". It is another vessel that is part of the LAD.

ID -- not relevant.

Cday -- "day of cardiac catheterization". Not relevant.

-   Autoencoders

**Conclusion:**

The following 3 questions were formulated in our proposal:

"Are some parameters more likely to be associated with heart disease?"

"Can we find any differences between the different locations?"

"Can different levels of a heart disease be differentiated from each
other?"

With the random forest method, 25 features were selected that could
explain about 80% of the data. A list with the top five most important
features for each location taking in account the different class
distributions for a heart disease was listed from page 5-8. Of note is
that no irrelevant features for the risk of CVDs were excluded from the
analysis (e.g. ID in Switzerland and Vancouver). Interestingly, the ID
parameter was classified as important for predicting the outcome by the
algorithm. This shows the discrepancy between an algorithm and medical
application for defining important risk factors for a CVDs.

Regarding the prediction of heart disease, this project is sobering. For
some datasets, the prediction was not good and a variation in the
accuracy regarding the different classification methods for predicting
risk factors was observed (chapter V).

Differences of selection of risk factors for predicting heart disease
were shown between locations (pages 5-8). Furthermore, additional minor
differences between locations were observed when performing an
Exploratory Data Analysis, for instance, for the distribution of age and
the type of disease. One reason could be that those locations showed a
similar socio-demographic structure in 1998.

Lastly, differences between class conditions for heart disease were
difficult to discern as results showed no clear clustering for each
class conditions when using different classification methods.

**Limitation and Outlook:**

In retrospect, were now able to reflect on the project and to discuss
improvements that could be made on further projects. We start with the
limitation:

-   The dataset was a bit outdated. The conditions have changed
    since 1998.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The Swiss dataset was highly unbalanced (very few 0's and 4's in the
    "num"). Consequently, ROC-scores for some classification methods
    could not be obtained. In addition, the Swiss dataset has no
    information on the cholesterol level (default 0), which means no
    second scatter plot could be to be plotted. Overall, the Swiss data
    set was not very suitable for this analysis. The above-mentioned
    difficulties were (amongst other things) responsible for the low
    model accuracy.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Some features (incl. class distributions of heart disease) were not
    described. We do not know, how these features were collected or
    measured. Also, some features are missing in datasets, for instance,
    cholesterol in the Swiss dataset.

Having said that, we also record some thoughts for further improvements:

-   We can fine-tune the model parameters for each dataset to achieve
    higher accuracy. That means the pipeline may look different and it
    may not be possible anymore to compare different regions, but the
    accuracy might increase.

-   Expanding the choice of the features to maybe 50 would be
    interesting. Also, maybe a reduction could gain more insights.

-   Excluding features thought to be irrelevant.

-   Working with a current dataset on heart disease and then compare the
    results between old datasets and new ones. What did change, what
    stayed the same?
